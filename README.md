# Problem state 

## Creating a Task tree with subtasks and return a tasktree groups the tasks by the parent class

> let's say we want to create a todo app with tasks  and we have created a task 

> the task is ("Learn how the internet works") now in this point we have no problem at all 

> But when we want to add subtasks we have to loop only in one or tow levels or more than that 

> We can hard code the solution to get the Task subtasks but we only have access to one level 

> Which means if we want to get deeper with these objects we have to limit or hard core how much levels we can go 

> in the file [tasks.py](./task.py) you can find a breakdown for the solution
